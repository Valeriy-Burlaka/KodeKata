The very first model answer shows that it's clueless about the task:
1. No clarifying questions (Gemini Pro 1.5 did much better in this stage, although not perfectly).
2. The very first generated code snippet already included garbage, like _backend_ parameters for "cell size" and "grid size".

Decided to not proceed further.
