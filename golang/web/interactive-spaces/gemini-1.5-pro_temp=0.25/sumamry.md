I was not impressed by the result and I think that arriving to a working implementation would take more effort than if I were implementing the code myself.
The 400 (input limit) errors are a bummer. I don't understand what is the point of the advertised "1M context size" for Gemini models, if they can't handle an input >8000 tokens.
